During the 2024 Olympic Games hosted in Paris, the public transports went through many changes in order to sustain the high number of people taking the public transports(more than usual).Indeed,many tourists and french people wished to assist to the different Olympic Games Events, "In total, 10,8 million tickets have been sold(paralympic games included),within those 10,8 millions, 8,6 million are for the "general public".Within this "general public", 62% of the tickets (4,8 million) have been bought in France(2,2 million in Ile de France) and 38% outside of France", this is what "Le Parisien" claims about the statistics of the sold tickets for the 2024 Olympic Games.The public transport lines welcomed millions more passengers than usually.Thus, the most frequented lines (outside the Olympic Games) continued their normal service in order to ensure transportation to the major sites of the event.Lines such as, metro lines 5 to 14, Tramway 2, T3A,T4B aswell as the RER B,C and D, finally, some trainlines like the J,L,N,P and U will ensure service like usually aswell.Those lines will serve as the best transportation mean to get to the Stade de France, Parc des Princes and La Defense Arena.

To ensure a top quality security, a security protocol has been concieved and put to work during this period.This protocol consisted of closing some stations which were deemed "strategic" or sensible in order to have a grasp over the passenger flux.Main stations like Champs Elysees Clemenceau, St Denis to Bobigny or Concorde et Tuileries have been closed during the duration of the event.This protocol aimed at decreasing the total number of available lines in order to facilitate the security team's jobs.Indeed, the more the lines there is , the more the staff would have had to split on a greater zone, opposed to a more limited zone with more staff.

As opposed to those closed lines, there were lines opened 24/7 who were also reinforced aswell.The afore mentioned metros like 1,4 to 14, aswell as RER A and B were accessible even after midnight in order to ensure the security of spectators seeking to get home after an event, or to ensure the transportation of new visitors coming through aeroports or train lines.

One of the major consequences caused by this new system was a huge spike of agglomeration on certain lines.Indeed, by concentrating the number of people on a smaller transport zone,it directly increased the number of people taking the transports at a given hour,thus creating agglomeration.However, this protocol had good intentions as it aimed at limiting the risks people were facing.
