        <h4>
            How were the facilities at the Olympic sports locations (including these 3 sports) designed to function during the Olympic and Paralympic Games? : 
        </h4>
        <p>
            
            The facilities were designed according to various criteria: 
            Environmental preservation :       
            Preserve traffic routes as much as possible, as well as the access to public spaces and services.
            Respect of the protection measures implemented in collaboration with the ABF (Architectes des Bâtiments de France). These measures are designed to preserve the unique features of our historic monuments and sites
            Most of the Olympic and Paralympic events' locations are far from French heritage sites, to limit the risk of deterioration.
            For event locations that are close to heritage sites, heritage sites potentially at risk of damage from the Olympic and Paralympic Games (vegetated areas, buildings, etc.) have been identified and appropriate protection measures have been put in place (wooden protections, barriers, etc.).		 
             Economic preservation : 
            Limit the negative impact of the event locations on various businesses and companies.
            Social preservation : 
            Limit noise pollution from the event sites for residents and local residents
            Large number of nearby public transport services and short journey times by public transport
            Ability to accommodate large numbers of spectators
