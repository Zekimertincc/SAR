        <h1>Infrastructures Sportives</h1>
        <br>
        <h4>Hôtel de villes</h4>
        <p>
            Building Description:
            The Hôtel de Ville of Paris is located in the 4th arrondissement, distinguished by its majestic facade measuring 143 meters in length and 18.80 meters in height (26.80 meters for the corner pavilions and 50 meters for the clock tower). The current building, in neo-Renaissance style, was rebuilt by architects Théodore Ballu and Édouard Deperthes on the site of the former Hôtel de Ville, which was burned during the Paris Commune in 1871. Since 1357, it has been the seat of the Paris municipal administration.
            
            Event:
            Formerly known as Place de Grève, the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville is now a lively site for exhibitions and culture. For these 2024 Olympic Games, it has been transformed into a magnificent playing field, from where athletes launched into the 42.195km marathon across the capital.
            
            Advantages and Disadvantages:
            Being in the center of Paris, the access to the Hôtel de Ville is very easy, serviced by many Parisian public transports, avoiding congestion.
            The downside of being in central Paris is the lack of space to organize events and the road closures during the competitions.
        </p>
        <h4>Invalide</h4>
        <p>
            Invalides

            Building Description:
            The Hôtel des Invalides, located in the heart of Paris, was built under Louis XIV in 1687 as a military hospital and retirement home for war veterans. Today, this world-renowned building houses museums and monuments all referring to French military history, including the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte. Opposite it, the elegant Pont Alexandre III connects it to the Grand Palais on the right bank of the Seine.
            
            Event:
            For these 2024 Olympic Games, the Esplanade des Invalides has been set up to host archery and para-archery events.
            
            Advantages and Disadvantages:
            Being in the center of Paris, the Esplanade is easily accessible and well-served by many public transports.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Stade de France
        </h4>
        <p>
            Building Description:
            Since the World Cup, this multi-sports arena, which remains the number one stadium in the country, has continued to host the biggest sporting events organized in France, such as the World Athletics Championships in 2003, the Rugby World Cup in 2007, the Euro 2016 football tournament, and soon the Rugby World Cup in 2023. Every year, matches of the French football and rugby teams are held in its grounds, and some of the biggest concerts by French and international stars are organized here.
            
            Event:
            For these 2024 Olympic Games, the stadium has been renovated to host athletics and rugby sevens events.
            
            Advantages and Disadvantages:

        <h4>
            Trocadéro
        </h4>
        <p>
            Building Description:
            The Palais du Trocadéro, built for the 1878 World's Fair, is an iconic monument located in Paris, on the Trocadéro hill, facing the Eiffel Tower. Its eclectic architecture, blending neo-classical and Moorish styles, is distinguished by its large facades, balconies, and sculptures.
            
            Event:
            For these 2024 Olympic Games, the Trocadéro has been temporarily set up to host triathlon and para-triathlon, road cycling, athletics (marathon and 20 km walk), and swimming (10 km open water).
            
            Advantages and Disadvantages:
            Being located in the 16th arrondissement, the Trocadéro is well-served by public transport, making it easily accessible for spectators.
            The massive influx of spectators in this place, which is not designed for such crowds, can make the experience less enjoyable for visitors.
